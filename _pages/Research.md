### Research Experiance

#### Computer Vision based Outdoor High Altitude GPS Denied Navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)

My interests have always been to see the nation progress through technology, always wanting to build products that would be beneficial for the whole society. I was fortunate enough to be able to work on such a project during my Final Year internship - developing a Visual Navigation system for border surveillance drones for the Indian Army. During this project, I was able to perform thorough research on various Computer Vision algorithms and successfully integrate the drone. After successful simulations, the drone was successfully tested in the real world through multiple test flights. Overall, it was a fun and enriching experience for me.

Project was executed for the Indian Army as part of my internship at[ Indrones Solutions](https://indrones.com/), a company developing drone based solutions for various use cases, under the guidance of [Dr. Apurva Joshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apurva-joshi-iitb/) and [Arvind Pandit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arvind-pandit-683158184/). I used computer vision to localize the drone by comparing camera image with satellite map of the area (Image Registration. SIFT feature tracking was used for dead reckoning.

Apart from core algorithm development my work involved integration with Ardupilot, deployment on microprocessors and testing on the simulator. I also helped to develop a physical drone and then tested it on testing grounds. The drone was able to navigate without GPS at a height of 100m AGL and even over mountainous terrains. The project helped me learn various core concepts from robotics, drone technology and Computer Vision.

I am Aatmaj Mhatre, a PhD student at Computer Science and Engineering Department of Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B). My primary areas of interest are Computer Vision, Machine Learning, IoT and Cyber Security.

I have done B.Tech in Computer Engineering (2021-25) with an additional minor degree in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR / VR) from K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai. During my B.Tech, I got exposure to lot of diverse fields that helped me shape up my career. I was research intern at [Indrones Solutions](https://indrones.com/), where we were building drones for military surveillance.

I like to think of myself as making meaningful contributions to the world through innovative technology solutions, particularly in the area of Video Analytics and Computer Vision, where I am currently focusing on developing cutting-edge IoT solutions for industry problems. 🌟

I like to build software projects 🧑🏽‍💻 on my own - my GitHub account is filled with all sorts of interesting projects across various domains! You can find more about my projects on my [resume](./files/Resume.pdf)

Apart from development, I also do research in various Computer Science related fields and have been able to publish four papers at IEEE conferences so far, in areas such as AI, Network Analysis, IoT and Software Engineering. 😃 You can check them [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ky53uMcAAAAJ).


### Extra Curricular

Also, I have been practising Sahaja Yoga meditation from a very young age which has helped me stay inspired & focused. You can read more about Sahaja Yoga Meditation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12o2GNq6clqC08mbaqUWEIKMPdhdUsIuI/view?usp=sharing)

I play musical instruments (Indian Classical) Tabla and Violin and have been a performing artist for quite some time now. And that is how my left - right brain (analytical - creative) balanced approach fires me up to solve problems, way better!💫
